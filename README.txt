The source code for the topology algorithm is in njtree.tar.gz
The source code for the distance algorithm is in nntree.tar.gz

Files need to be processed using nntree/setup.csh followed by single.csh
production runs are then made with braid.csh

Example data files are currently too big for github and smaller 'toy'
examples are being prepared and will be uploaded soon.
